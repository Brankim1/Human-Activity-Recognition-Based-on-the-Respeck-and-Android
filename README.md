Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Machine Learning Algorithm and Applications: Based on the Respeck and Android System

This paper presents an Android application that could implement Human Activity Recognition(HAR). The HAR algorithm based on the CNN model that could classify seven activities(Falling, Walking, Sitting, Running, Lying, Descending stairs and Climbing stairs). This model could get 94% accuracy in the training set and 86% at the test set. Based on the HAR results, this software achieves many functions, such as history data view, sedentary reminder and falling alert. In addition, the user could also customise their software, such as Max sitting time in the sedentary reminder and emergency contact phone number in the fall alert. Next, the application supports authentication that could access it at any device and stored data in the Cloud. Finally, this application has an intuitive user interface that could provide a user-friendly experience.
